    Q: "What is a FAQ page?",
    A: `   In contrast to a landing page, where the goal is to convert buyers,
            the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is a part of your
            website where you address common concerns, questions, and objections
            that customers have. It’s different from your About Us page where
            you tell the broader story behind your brand. The FAQ section,
            instead, deals with the details. It's the go-to destination for
            finding answers to specific questions about your product or business
            operation. `,
  },
  {
    Q: "How should I answer my FAQs?",
    A: `      How you position your answers is key. Even if the question is about
            a potential shortcoming in your product or business, put on your PR
            hat and put a positive spin on your answer. While you should
            demonstrate authority through the depth of your answers, be sure
            you’re not losing your audience by giving them more than they need.
            Write your questions from your customer's perspective (e.g. "How do
            I...") and answer from your business's perspective (e.g. "You
            should..." or "We provide..."). Tattly does a great job of using
            their customer voice to phrase the questions, while still
            maintaining clarity.  `,

    Q: "When is a FAQ page appropriate?",
    A: `       An FAQ page can be a distraction or an asset, depending on how you
            execute it. But to ensure that it’s the latter, here are some
            indications that it’s time to incorporate a FAQ page as part of your
            website: Customers email you with the same questions on an ongoing
            basis, so it’s better to address them publicly and prominently. You
            have or plan to create content/landing pages that you can link to
            and continue the journey from question to conversion. Your product
            /service/business raises questions and concerns that are best
            handled in a straightforward manner. That last point is especially
            important as a FAQ page presents a unique opportunity to directly
            address concerns and remove obstacles on the path to purchase.  `,

  {
    Q: "Where should I put my FAQ section?",
    A: `    Drumroll: It depends. If customer service is a core part of your
            business, you might want to create a fully fleshed out support
            center or “help desk”, using HelpDesk or Zendesk, with a FAQ
            incorporated as part of your customer support flow (i.e. customers
            check the FAQ before they reach out to a customer service rep). But
            if you’re selling products or services that are bound to generate a
            lot of questions, it might be enough to prominently display a link
            to a simple FAQ page in your website navigation to focus on reducing
            purchasing anxieties for visitors. WaterAid links to their FAQ page
            from the main menu, in their About section.        `,
